# Aircraft safety Risk Assessment project
A company is expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and 
operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft

# Business understanding
The company being new to aircraft enterprise, lacks experience in aircraft risk assessment. its therefore important to determine which aircraft has lowest risks for the organization to makes decisions on which aircraft to purchase
A company being new to aircraft enterprise, lacks experience in aircraft risk assessment.
its therefore important to determine which aircraft has lowest risks for the organization to makes decisions on which aircraft to purchase.
## Business objectives 
1) To determine the safest aircrafts make/models

2) To evaluate aircraft safety Risks based on purpose of flight

3) To analyze state operational risks

# Data
Source of Data: US Aviation  Accident and Incident Database from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and 
international waters and US States Code data 

# Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis, and calculation of key metrics to determine the safest aircraft make/model, evaluate aircraft safety risks based on the purpose of
flight and analyze state operational risks

Key metrics
Fatality Rate= Fatal injuries / Total People
Injury Rates= (Fatal + Serious + minor injuries) / total people
Incident Count(for significance)

# Results

Top 10 aircraft make/model sorted using fatality rate according to the number of incident or accident occurence. and from that we can 
deduce that Piper PA-31T2 make model has the highest fatality rate, followed by BEECH H18 make model with 80% fatality rates, models like 
CESSNA 310H, BEECH B95A, CESSNA 320D, MITSUBISHI MU-2B-60 have moderate fatality and make model Air Command 532 and Rockell 112 Have the lowest fatality risks.

After selecting the activities by event counts of more than 100, purpose of flight with the highest fatality rate is Air race/show with fatality rate of about 30%, business and aerial observation purpose follows with fatality rate of about 25%.

The activities with moderate risks are public aircraft purpose and personal of less than 25%

the flight purpose with lowest fatality rate is public aircraft-state with fatality rate of 17%

The state with the highest fatality rate, and in this case those states are unknown probably because the states records were not 
recorded during incident or accident occurrence.

The top state with higher fatality rate then the rest is Guam, it is a USA state territory and its leading in fatality rates.

The middle states like Arizona have moderate fatality rates as compared to the ones at the top. Connecticut, New Mexico, 
West Virginia have less than 15% fatality rate which makes it ideal for aviation operations.

# Conclusion
Based on the above analysis:

1) make/model safe are Air Command 532 and Rockell 112 and models like CESSNA 310H, BEECH B95A, CESSNA 320D, MITSUBISHI MU-2B-60 have moderate fatality rates. Air Command 532 and Rockell 112 are safe aircrafts models for private and commercial business.

2) Upon Evaluation of risks associated with the purpose of flight, air race/show emerged as the activity with highest fatality rate, this activity should be therefore be avoided when the company ventures into the new aviation business

3) On states operational risks, states with high fatality rates are unknown, this requires improvement on data collection when the incidents occur to inform in decision making
